**in-built lists are allowed**. `dict` and `sorted` are not allowed 

### Q1: Minimum Absolute Difference in BST 
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the kth largest element in the array.  

Can you solve it without sorting? See if you can obtain a complexity less than $O(n + k\cdot \log n)$ where $n$ is the length of `nums`.  

**Example 1**  
Input: `nums` = [3,2,1,5,6,4], `k` = 2  
Output: 5  


**Example 2**  
Input: `nums` = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], `k` = 4  
Output: 4

### Testing you algorithm
- To run tests, open terminal then:
```sh
python3 run_tests.py # and follow command line instructions
```

- If you encounter errors with the above, make sure that at least python runs on terminal
```sh
python3
```

- You may be directed to Microsoft Store (Windows), if so install python from there
- For if issues persist on Mac,  see this: https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/
